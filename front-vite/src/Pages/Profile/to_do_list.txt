implement different profile pages //check

i need to make a cap of the ammount of letters accepted as a username

if a user send a friendrequest, a notification gets send to the other user
i need to make it so that you can only send 1 request per a cetrain amount of time
if user accepts the invite, the button dissapears, if not then not

if user has been block by other, the add friend button doesn't dissapear but it doesn't send a notification

if a message is send through the profile page, we need to make a notification with the message and store it in the chat
if the message is send to someone who has blocked the current user, the message doens't get send
if the user presses on the notification or the chat, the message should also appear there

if a user sends a invite to game request, a notification gets send
i need to make it so that you can only send 1 request per a cetrain amount of time
if other accepts, private game room gets created

as for the friend section,
if user is on its own page, the buttons are there
if user is on other users profilepage, the buttons should dissapear

the name of the friend is also a link to their profilepage, so i need their id

if the user presses on the remove friend button, the person gets removed from friends list

if the user presses on the block button, the preson gets removed from to friends list and be added to the blocked list
i need to make a list of blocked people that only the user can see, dont know on which page yet

as for the game section,
i need access to the game database,
i need to know what type of game it is, the score and against whom
i also need to see if the user won or lost, if user won it would show 'WON' in green, else 'LOST' in red
i need to calculate the ratio of win/lose




fetchuserprofile works with intraID, but i need to make it so that it works with the lastsegment
i need to make a way to find the lastsegment in the database
		// try {
		// 	const user = await fetchUserProfile(lastSegment);
		// 	if (!user) {
		// 	  console.error('User not found');
		// 	  return;
		// 	}
		// 	console.log("haha");
		// 	console.log(user.id);
		// 	console.log(user.nameIntra);
		// 	// if (lastSegment == user.id) {
		// 	//   return (pageWrapperUser(user));
		// 	// } else {
		// 	//   return (pageWrapperOther(user));
		// 	// }
		//   } catch (error) {
		// 	console.error('Error fetching user profile:', error);
		//   }
