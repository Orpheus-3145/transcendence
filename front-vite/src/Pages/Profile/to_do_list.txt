implement different profile pages //check

if a user send a friendrequest, a notification gets send to the other user
i need to make it so that you can only send 1 request per a cetrain amount of time
if user accepts the invite, the button dissapears, if not then not

if user has been block by other, the add friend button doesn't dissapear but it doesn't send a notification

if a message is send through the profile page, we need to make a notification with the message and store it in the chat
if the message isse nd to someone who has blocked the current user, the message doens't get send
if the user presses on the notification or the chat, the message should also appear there

if a user sends a invite to game request, a notification gets send
i need to make it so that you can only send 1 request per a cetrain amount of time
if other accepts, private game room gets created

as for the friend section,
if the user presses on the block button, the preson gets removed from to friends list and be added to the blocked list
i need to make a list of blocked people that only the user can see, dont know on which page yet

as for the game section,
i need access to the game database,
i need to know what type of game it is, the score and against whom
i also need to see if the user won or lost, if user won it would show 'WON' in green, else 'LOST' in red
i need to calculate the ratio of win/lose
